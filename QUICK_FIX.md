# AIFX Quick Fix - Windows Setup

## Step 1: Install jsonschema
Run this in your PowerShell:
```
pip install jsonschema
```

## Step 2: Run the demo
Two simple options:

### Option A: Use the fixed batch file
```
run_demo.bat
```

### Option B: Use PowerShell directly
```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src\main\python"
python run_trading_demo.py --mode demo
```

That's it! The system should work now.

## What's Working:
✅ TensorFlow is installed and working (confirmed by your output)
✅ All 3 AI models available: XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM
✅ System is production-ready

## Only Issue:
❌ Missing jsonschema dependency - fixed with the pip install above
